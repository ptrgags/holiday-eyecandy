# Holiday Eyecandy (2018)

This is a 2D graphics project I made as a holiday present for my friends like
I usually do. This year, my project is about fractals and tilings

## Tutorial

See https://youtu.be/HcMnmkLy91Q for an overview of the website and how
it works.

## Special Thanks

Thanks to my friend [@IzzyEevee](https://github.com/IzzyEevee) for helping me
with the UI design, beta testing, and picking presets.
